This is the emacs config I use. Modified from [here](https://github.com/flyingmachine/emacs-for-clojure). I modified the config to use the latest packages from melpa-stable and fixed some deprecated/removed functions.

Make sure to edit the last line in `init.el` if you don't use the Inconsolata font.
